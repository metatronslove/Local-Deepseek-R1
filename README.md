# Local-Deepseek-R1
Deepseek-Chat provides a modern desktop interface for local language models through Ollama. Built with PyQt5, it features persistent chat history, real-time model switching, and a clean dark theme UI. Perfect for users seeking a professional platform for local AI interactions. This was built literally over night so don't be too critical, its mostly just to give the community an alternative UI to use and hopefully create an environment of improving it too.

# Known Issues & Pitfalls

## Core Issues

1. **System Resource Management**
   - Memory usage isn't properly monitored or limited for chat history
   - No cleanup mechanism for old chat files and metadata
   - Large chat histories could impact performance

2. **Error Handling**
   - Ollama connection errors aren't gracefully handled
   - Network timeout scenarios need better management
   - Model loading failures lack proper user feedback

3. **State Management**
   - Duplicate handle_error() method implementations
   - Potential race conditions in chat history updates
   - Message history isn't properly synced between components

## UI/UX Concerns

1. **Chat Display**
   - No message loading indicators
   - Messages aren't paginated for large conversations
   - MathJax rendering can cause layout shifts

2. **Model Selection**
   - No validation of model availability before switching
   - Missing model download progress indicators
   - No feedback if selected model isn't installed

## Performance Opportunities

1. **Optimization Needs**
   - Chat history panel animation could be smoother
   - Message formatting is done synchronously
   - WebEngine view could be optimized for better performance

2. **Caching**
   - No caching mechanism for frequently used responses
   - Chat history loads entire conversation at once
   - Model switching doesn't preserve conversation context

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Security**
   - Chat data stored in plaintext
   - No encryption for persistent storage
   - No user authentication mechanism

## Future Improvements

1. **Critical Features**
   - Add chat export functionality
   - Implement conversation search
   - Add proper file attachment handling

2. **Code Structure**
   - Split large classes into smaller components
   - Implement proper dependency injection
   - Add comprehensive testing suite
